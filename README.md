KeyLights for MacOS X

KeyLights is based on Apple samples for USB keyboards.
It was written as a quick way to turn the lights on my son's external USB keyboard (beacuse Mac's don't recognise SCROLL-LOCK, it seems).

It will scan keyboard and allow you to toggle what appear to be lights.
You can save settings and automatically load them when the application starts.

Simple enough.
